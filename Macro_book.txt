Introduction

1.1 Main objectives

This book re-examines the basis of current macro-economic policy 
making and attempts to establish new micro-foundations bringing 
together some elements of the work of Keynes[footnote:
It should be emphasised that the focus of this work is neither to 
discuss ‘what Keynes really meant’, nor to suggest that the work 
of Keynes is without error. There are however, a number of 
central, and almost self-evident, propositions in his work which 
have not been incorporated into the body of modern macroeconomic 
theory, because they undermine either the axioms or the overall 
vision of modern macroeconomic theory.
] and a behavioural approach to economic theory and policy. When 
we discuss the work of Keynes we are not referring simply to the 
idea of fiscal policy for demand management, as Keynesian theory 
came to be characterised in the post-war period. Rather we focus 
on the central insights of his work in The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest and Money (Keynes 1936) as well as the 
follow up articles to the General Theory, ‘The General Theory of 
Employment’, ‘The “ex-ante” Theory of the Rate of Interest’, ‘
Alternative Theories of the Rate of Interest’ Keynes (1937a), Keynes (1937b), and Keynes (1937c)
 and, most importantly, How to Pay for the War Keynes (1940). The 
central insights of Keynes were that: 

1. There is no automatic adjustment mechanism in a market economy 
  ensuring that it will return quickly to a full employment 
  equilibrium (even if all prices and wages are fully flexible).

2. Consumption and investment decisions are often made under 
  conditions of pure uncertainty, where there is no rational 
  basis for the decision and therefore may be the result of 
  hopes, fears and imagined futures which have no basis in 
  objective reality.

3. Savings and investment are equilibrated by changes in 
  investment, not interest rates.

4. Long term interest rates are determined by the desire for 
  liquidity and expectations about the future. 

These insights have largely been lost from contemporary 
macroeconomic theory and policy, for reasons which will be 
discussed in future chapters. These insights are also very 
compatible with behavioural economics, and particularly the 
strand of behavioural economics referred to by Earl (2022) and Sent (2004)
 as the ‘Old Behavioural Economics’. Old Behavioural Economics is 
derived from the work of Simon (1955), Simon (1956), Simon (1979), Simon (1991), and Simon (1996)
 and also includes the work on the theory of the firm such as Hall and Hitch (1939)
, Cyert and March (1963) and Richardson (1953), Richardson (1959), and Richardson (1960)
. Simon recognised that the central axiom of economic theory (and 
policy), that decisions made by people and firms to rationally 
maximise utility or profits was an impossibility. It was 
impossible both because the information required does not, and 
often could not possibly exist, and furthermore even if the 
information were to exist, humans do not have the cognitive 
capacity to process it all and (as orthodox economic theory 
assumes) examine all possible alternatives before taking a 
decision. He also developed an alternative decision theory, 
rooted in empirical work in psychology.

Among the most important consequences of his work was the idea 
that consumers could not be maximising intertemporal utility, 
using interest rates to discount future costs and benefits. 
Indeed, as will be seen in later chapters, there is a wealth of 
empirical evidence suggesting that individuals do not, and cannot 
apply consistent discount factors to the future and take 
decisions maximising intertemporal utility. In practice this 
means that the choice of what goods and services to consume, and 
how much to consume and to save, will be dominated by a few rules 
which produce satisfactory (but not optimal) outcomes. Simon 
referred to such decision rules as procedural rationality, as 
opposed to the substantive rationality of orthodox economics. It 
will be seen that the way individuals develop such rules means 
that their decisions may be very different those that would have 
resulted from intertemporal utility maximisation.

Cyert and March, Richardson and others applied these insights to 
the theory of the firm, and again demonstrated that firms cannot 
simply maximise profits because the information and knowledge 
required simply do not exist. The firms have to use policies and 
procedures which produce satisfactory results. It is impossible 
to know whether these would have been optimal. This applies 
particularly when developing new products or opening new markets. 
Demand curves and marginal costs are unknown in such cases, and 
will change with as the product enters a new market. New 
investment is inevitably a question of taking a decision under 
extreme uncertainty and with very little reliable knowledge. As Keynes (1936)
 says:

“The outstanding fact is the extreme precariousness of the basis 
of knowledge on which our estimates of prospective yield have to 
be made. Our knowledge of the factors which will govern the yield 
of an investment some years hence is usually very slight and 
often negligible. If we speak frankly, we have to admit that our 
basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years hence of a 
railway, a copper mine, a textile factory, the goodwill of a 
patent medicine, an Atlantic liner, a building in the City of 
London amounts to little and sometimes to nothing; or even five 
years hence.”

In the modern context we could just as well argue that we have 
little or no idea about the changes to the economy and society of 
the widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence, how electric 
battery technology will evolve, whether USA will have become an 
inward looking authoritarian regime isolated from the rest of the 
world, or whether there will be further major wars over the next 
ten years. All of these will have enormous impacts on the return 
of investments, and we have no knowledge of the probabilities of 
these events nor of their impact on economy and society. One of 
the central themes of this book is that the returns to investment 
in physical capital are extremely uncertain, and so the model in 
which entrepreneurs compare ‘the interest rate’ to the returns to 
investment to determine whether it is viable, may be of limited 
use in explaining levels of investment. 

This article looks at both the technical and political economy 
aspects of fiscal and monetary policy to understand how and why 
this transformation took place. It is argued that the use of 
monetary policy as the principal instrument to control inflation, 
is technically flawed while the experience of monetary policy 
over the past 30 or so years shows how the political economy 
issues that led to the decline of fiscal policy as the main 
instrument of demand management can now be overcome, so as to 
achieve effective macroeconomic management, consistent with a 
dynamic and fair economy.

1.2 Methodology



A brief summary of macroeconomic policy from 1930

2.1 Macroeconomic policy in the early 20th century

Prior to the 1930's it is difficult to talk about ‘Macroeconomic 
policy’ as such. Government spending was relatively low and 
concentrated on administration and defence. Taxes were raised to 
finance government spending, and, exceptionally, particularly 
during wartime, fiscal deficits were financed by the issue of 
bonds. Monetary policy was largely confined to moving interest 
rates occasionally in response to inflows or outflows of gold as 
most of the world was on the Gold Standard from the last quarter 
of the 19[superscript:th] century. The prevailing view among both academics and 
governments was that the economy was self regulating, and 
although fluctuations were observed with periods of both 
inflation and deflation, these were held to be self-correcting, 
with the gold standard providing stability for international 
trade. Prior to 1914 there was an unprecedented process of 
globalisation and a general belief that major wars would be 
impossible due to the economic and trade links between countries. 

2.2 The collapse of the 1930s and beginnings of macroeconomic 
  policy

Fiscal management of demand can said to have begun (in a 
piecemeal fashion) with Roosevelt’s New Deal in the US which 
supported programs of public works to alleviate unemployment in 
the Great Depression. It was given a theoretical basis with the 
publication of Keynes’ General Theory of Employment, Interest and 
Money (Keynes 1936), which together with the practical experience 
of the wartime management of the US and UK economies in the 
1940’s, formed the basis for post-war macroeconomic management 
from 1945 to the mid 1970’s.

2.3 The dominance of fiscal policy to 1970

From the late 1930’s, with the combination of the great 
depression and Keynes critique of orthodox classical economics, 
it was broadly accepted by policy makers that fiscal policy had a 
central role in the management of aggregate demand. This 
consensus began to break down in the 1960’s and it is probably 
fair to say that for most of the last forty years monetary policy 
(with a few exceptions) has been accepted as the only legitimate 
instrument for the management of demand, and thus inflation, in 
most countries.

Initial attempts to use monetary policy to manage demand in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, used a crude (and ineffective) 
monetarist interpretation of the link between the ‘money supply’ 
and the price level, as a means to controlling inflation. Early 
attempts at monetary base control showed that the link between 
monetary aggregates and inflation was tenuous and unpredictable. 
However, the experience did demonstrate that sufficiently high 
interest rates could depress economic activity sufficiently to 
eventually eliminate inflation (particularly when combined with 
institutional changes to weaken workers bargaining power), 
although at the cost of high unemployment and lost output.

Although fiscal policy was the dominant instrument of 
macroeconomic management in the post-war period, it was 
supplemented by monetary policy, often in the form of direct 
controls on bank lending, or the conditions of consumer credit. 
In the period of fixed exchange rates until 1973, the interest 
rate was used more for managing foreign exchange flows, to 
maintain the fixed exchange rate, than to directly control 
inflation.

The effectiveness of fiscal policy (and wartime spending) in 
creating full employment led to the consensus that full 
employment should be one of the central objectives of economic 
policy in the vast majority of market economies. There were also 
instruments and models including the crude IS-LM framework, which 
(falsely) claimed to be a formal version of Keynes theoretical 
work, together with the apparently strong empirical inverse 
relationship between unemployment and inflation formalised as the 
Phillips Curve (Phillips 1958). These instruments and models 
created the belief amongst macroeconomic policy makers that 
maintaining full employment was possible, and a relatively simple 
technical matter of fine-tuning fiscal policy to boost demand if 
unemployment were to rise and to reduce demand when inflation 
rose.

2.4 The crisis of policy making in the 1970s

From 1945 until about 1970 macroeconomic management in OECD 
countries appeared to have achieved full employment with steady 
growth and low (but gradually increasing) inflation. During this 
period average inflation in the US, the UK, France, Germany and 
Japan was vv, yy, zz, ww, xx, respectively while unemployment 
rates were of the order of 3% - 4%. There is little doubt that 
this period was probably the most successful in terms of 
crisis-free, sustained positive macroeconomic results for most 
western industrialised countries that had ever been observed.

Strains in the system were however manifesting themselves. The 
policy focus was on maintaining full employment, but the Phillips 
curve trade-off which had been previous identified between the 
rate of unemployment and the level of inflation appeared to be 
breaking down, so that from the mid 1960’s inflation levels 
associated with a given level of unemployed resources was 
gradually rising.

Moreover, the world financial system was effectively on a US 
dollar standard, with US dollars being the principal reserve 
currency for all other countries. Expansionary fiscal policy in 
the US, designed both to generated full employment and finance 
the Vietnam war, meant that there was effectively a surplus of 
dollars in the rest of the world. The anchor of the Bretton Woods 
world financial system was the dollar which had a value fixed, 
and was freely convertible to gold, held in reserve by the US 
Treasury. Differing fiscal policies and inflation rates among the 
large industrial economies, meant that disequilibria were 
transmitted into the balance of payments, with deficit countries 
under pressure to tighten policy in order to correct the external 
disequilibrium.

This pressure, however, did not apply to the US. Its balance of 
payments deficit (dollar surplus) simply translated into 
increases in dollar reserves held by other countries. This came 
to be known as the ‘exorbitant privilege’ of the US. The system 
could only be stable as long as the link between the dollar and 
gold was credible. From the mid sixties this credibility began to 
be tested by Central Banks, particularly in Europe, which began 
increasing, their holdings of gold, by exchanging dollars for 
gold. As US gold reserves diminished, it was clear that something 
would have to give. In the end the US simply suspended the 
convertibility of dollars to gold, thus effectively ending the 
Bretton Woods system and ushering in the system of floating 
exchange rates.

2.4.1 Acceleration of inflation in the 1970s

The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971 was followed 
very quickly by a sharp increase in world commodity prices 
(particularly oil which quadrupled in price in 1973 and further 
tripled in price from 1979 to 1981). These price increases came 
on top of an inflation rate which had gradually increased in the 
previous decades. The result was that inflation increased 
rapidly, peaking in 1974 or 1975 in most countries as the 
external supply shock fed into domestic inflation. Policy 
responses were varied and often incoherent. In the UK for 
example, in 1973 fiscal policy became more expansionary, while 
subsequent inflation was dealt with by an (ineffective) wage 
control policy which quickly broke down. In the US the break with 
Bretton Woods was also combined with the announcement of a wage 
and price freeze. In most cases direct controls on wages and 
prices proved to be at best temporary palliatives.

2.4.2 The difficult political economy of fiscal policy

While fiscal policy could potentially be very effective for the 
management of aggregate demand from a technical perspective, the 
political economy of fiscal management proved to be too complex, 
in the sense that increases in expenditure (or reductions in 
taxation) to stimulate growth or offset an increase in 
unemployment were politically very difficult to reverse once the 
economy began to overheat. Thus, in practice, building in a bias 
towards expansionary fiscal policy which would only be confronted 
once a crisis was generated through accelerating inflation and/or 
a balance of payments collapse.

2.5 The dominance of monetary policy

This led to the development of a consensus from the late 1980’s 
that the only appropriate instrument to regulate demand was 
monetary policy (focused particularly on the use of short term 
interest rates to influence the entire yield curve through 
expectations), while fiscal policy was relegated to service 
delivery and maintaining a ‘sustainable’ debt burden. By the 
1990’s, in many countries, this became formalised in the form of 
inflation targeting regimes, managed by independent Central 
Banks. This historical evolution is described in detail in the UK 
Treasury’s semi-official account of macroeconomic policy making (Balls and O'Donnell 2002)
, and in the US by Ben Bernanke’s analysis of monetary policy (Bernanke (2022)
).

2.5.1 Theoretical and historical origins of monetarism

Behind the rise of monetary policy as the dominant macroeconomic 
policy instrument was the fundamental notion that relative prices 
were determined only by ‘real factors’ (technology and 
preferences) from the solution of innumerable optimisation 
problems by individual agents resulting in a vector of ‘objective’
 equilibrium prices, while the price level was determined by the 
‘money supply’ (the ‘Classical dichotomy’). Although never 
demonstrated empirically, the ‘Classical Dichotomy’ became as 
central to macroeconomic thought as it had been in the 19th and 
early 20th centuries, and indeed has been highly influential in 
theoretical and policy discussions up to the present.

This view relies upon the idea that ‘money’ as a means of 
exchange can be clearly distinguished from other financial assets 
which constitute a store of future purchasing power.[footnote:
It is the existence of this wide range of financial assets which 
often led to endless and ultimately futile debates on the correct 
definition of ‘money’ for the purposes of controlling the money 
supply and thus inflation.
] The idea that ‘money’ (as opposed to other financial assets) 
has no utility in itself and is simply held for transactions 
purposes is the central assumption of the reformulation of the 
doctrine of monetarism by Milton Friedman in (Friedman 1956; Friedman 1969)
 (both reprinted in Friedman (2006)). 

Although the idea that the money supply (however defined) is a 
principal determinant of the price level dates back at least to 
the eighteenth century,[footnote:
See, for example, the work of David Hume
] it was articulated in its modern form in the 1950s by Milton 
Friedman. Friedman argued strongly that excessive growth of the 
money supply was the only cause of inflation, and that in policy 
terms the only solution to excessive price growth was to restrain 
the growth of the ‘money supply’. In the 1950’s and most of the 
1960’s monetarism was treated as a fringe doctrine which could 
not challenge the prevailing dominance of fiscal policy and the 
Keynesian orthodoxy of the time. However, by the end of the 
1960’s, it began to gain in credibility in academic circles, as 
it became clear that fiscal policy was apparently unable to 
stabilise the economy and ensure full employment with low 
inflation.

During the 1970’s monetarism gradually became the orthodoxy for 
macroeconomic policy making, almost by default, as the 
combination of rising inflation with economic stagnation and 
rising unemployment appeared to be intractable using the 
traditional instruments of fiscal policy, sometimes combined with 
wage and price controls.

Monetarism appeared to both provide a shortcut to the control of 
inflation, as well as an ideological framework for a reduction of 
state intervention in the economy. It began to be adopted in a 
soft form in the UK following the balance of payments crisis of 
1976 and in a much more ideologically pure fashion with election 
of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1979 (see Lankester (2024)
 for a detailed account of the UK experience). In the US 
monetarism as a policy doctrine came to the fore with the 
appointment of Paul Volker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 
1979 (see Bernanke (2022)).

2.5.2 Monetarism in practice

With its ascendancy in the UK and the US quickly began to 
dominate economic policy making and theorising in most OECD 
countries and, as a result of its diffusion through multilateral 
financial institutions, and their regional equivalents, to much 
of the developing world. The appeal of monetarism was not simply 
the apparent simplicity of its policy recommendations 
(controlling the money supply in order to control inflation), but 
also that it provided a theoretical basis for concepts such as 
the ‘Natural Rate of Unemployment’(Friedman 1968) (or as it was 
later called, the ‘Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of 
Unemployment’). This concept provided a rationale for arguing 
that the government had no role in trying to regulate the level 
of unemployment, since it would automatically move to its natural 
rate which Friedman argued would be the level:

“ground out by the Walrasian system of general equilibrium 
equations, provided there is embedded in them the actual 
structural characteristics of the labor and commodity markets, 
including market imperfections, stochastic variability in demands 
and supplies, the cost of gathering information about job 
vacancies and labor availabilities, the costs of mobility, and so 
on.”(Friedman 1968)

In this definition it is made clear that unemployment will be 
determined by the interaction of preferences and technology, and 
that if it is higher than is desired the only solutions can be 
microeconomic interventions to help the market to work better, 
but that there is no macroeconomic policy which can lower the 
rate of unemployment.

2.5.3 How does monetary policy work?

Monetary policy (largely through interest rate movements) may 
have effects on private consumption and investment decisions. 
However, once one removes the axiom of the maximisation of 
intertemporal utility as the dominant motivation for consumers, 
the scope for interest rates to affect private consumption 
decisions is considerably diminished. This is consistent with the 
empirical literature [cite sources] on the relatively low 
elasticity of consumption to interest rates.

Whether interest rates will affect private consumption 
significantly will depend very much on the institutional 
framework for consumption. In an economy in which a large part of 
the population buys houses on mortgages (particularly variable 
rate mortgages), there is no doubt that interest rates will 
affect income and consumption, both through the purchase of new 
housing (which also drives a significant part of the consumer 
durable market) and through the income and wealth effects on 
existing borrowers, where a rise in the interest rate will act as 
a tax on the borrower’s income and (over time) reduce the 
perceived value of assets (such as property). However, those 
parts of the population who are credit constrained (particularly 
the “poor”, as described above) or holders of financial assets 
(largely the “rich” from above) will, in the former case, be 
insensitive to interest rate changes, and in the latter, have a 
positive income effect for a rise in the interest rate. Thus the 
social and institutional structure will determine if there is any 
sensitivity of consumption to interest rate movements.

The relationship of physical investment to interest rates is also 
unlikely to be a smooth monotonic function. In the paradigm of 
the macroeconomic textbooks entrepreneurs have the choice of 
investing in numerous projects with a well defined rate of return 
(possibly with a well defined variance around the expected rate 
of return). If the expected rate of return (adjusted for risk) 
exceeds the interest rate (and the entrepreneur can secure the 
necessary capital - from borrowing, equity or own resources) the 
investment is likely to take place.

Hence, in this approach a fall in the (real) rate of interest 
will tend to raise the volume of investment, while a rise will 
diminish the volume of investment. There is little doubt that 
very high real rates of interest are effective in curtailing 
investment, and indeed severe monetary contractions can very 
quickly reduce investment levels, by raising enormously the risk 
of investment, at a moment when demand for final output is likely 
to fall. While the comparison of the relative returns on 
financial assets and physical investment may have some effect, 
there is little doubt that the principal effect of raising 
interest rates is to reduce the expected return of investment, 
through expected falls in aggregate demand. As discussed 
previously, the likelihood of a very high variance of the rate of 
return on investment (particularly in countries with weak 
institutional structures), is also likely to reduce the 
elasticity of investment to the rate of interest.

Low rates of interest, however, may not have symmetric effects. 
While they may reduce slightly the costs of investment, they will 
not increase expected returns by as much as high rates depress 
expected returns. The experience of ultra-low interest rates from 
2008 to 2022 is perhaps the clearest illustration of this point. 
There has not been an extraordinary investment boom by historical 
standards. Nor have zero real or nominal rates suddenly made 
previously unviable investments viable, precisely because of the 
uncertainty over returns. What low interest rates have done is to 
raise asset prices, (property, shares, cryptocurrency, etc.), 
often purchased using cheap credit to leverage returns,[footnote:
This is the essence of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, 
 which argues that financial crises are not aberrations or due to 
policy errors, but rather inherent characteristics of capitalist 
economies with financial markets.
] as wealth holders look for alternative (and often more risky) 
financial assets to produce a return, as discussed previously. 
Over time the rise in asset prices may also contribute to raising 
consumption through wealth effects, at the expense of increasing 
the risks of reversing monetary policy, as evidenced by the 
economic crises of 2008 and 2022.

All these considerations suggest that private expenditure on 
consumption and investment may be affected by monetary policy in 
an uncertain and unpredictable manner. The effects of monetary 
policy will depend upon changing views about the future, of both 
consumers and investors. They are unlikely to be linear or even 
monotonic. In these circumstances, while it may be possible to 
identify at a specific moment in time an interest rate which will 
be consistent with full employment of resources at a low 
inflation rate, there will be nothing natural or stable about 
this interest rate, and indeed, in many circumstances it may not 
exist. There is no reason that a natural interest rate should 
exist once we dispense with the idea that interest rates in some 
sense reflect a trade-off between present and future consumption 
for consumers engaged in an exercise of intertemporal utility 
maximisation, or that it is related to the real (unknowable) 
return to physical capital.

2.6 The global financial crisis and the era of ultra-low interest 
  rates

2.6.1 Secular stagnation

Over the last decade there has been considerable discussion of 
the world entering a period of ‘secular stagnation’. The ‘secular 
stagnation’ hypothesis was first introduced to discussions on 
economic policy by Alvin Hansen in an address to the American 
Economic Association . His argument was essentially that 
investment possibilities depended on either population growth or 
the rapid advance of technology, and that the apparent slowdown 
of technological innovation at the same time as a reduced growth 
of population had led to a fall in the level of investment 
relative to savings. The hypothesis was not borne out by history 
at the time.

However, the hypothesis was revived by Larry Summers in 2013  
following financial crisis of 2007–2008, and the observation that 
despite record low interest rates, there appeared to be no 
revival of inflation, while growth of output and employment 
remained modest.  notes that even prior to the 2007–2008 crisis 
the there was a general view that monetary policy had been too 
easy and that there was a large amount of imprudent borrowing. 
However, this lax monetary policy had not resulted in a great 
boom, capacity was not under any pressure and unemployment was 
not remarkable low, while inflation was well under control. Thus 
his argument was that there had been a secular decline in the 
‘neutral’ rate of interest, consistent with full employment and 
low inflation, as desired investment had not risen to match 
desired saving.

Moreover secular stagnation appeared to be a global phenomenon. 
Global interest rates had been falling since the early 1990s. The 
surplus of savings over investment in China has manifested itself 
through a sustained current account surplus and build up of 
foreign reserves. Japan has suffered from stagnation, deflation 
and negative interest rates for three decades and Europe and the 
US for at least two decades.  estimate that the world “neutral” 
real rate of interest has fallen by 300 basis points since 1980, 
but would have fallen by 700 points, had there not been 
significant offsets from fiscal and social insurance policies.

 argues that the phenomenon of secular stagnation raises serious 
policy dilemmas as as it becomes difficult to simultaneously 
achieve adequate growth, capacity utilisation, and financial 
stability. This paper will argue that there is a clear solution 
to this policy dilemma which has been obscured by a misleading 
narrative on the role of the interest rate in a market economy.

2.7 Covid, fiscal expansion and supply side bottlenecks



The theory and narrative of current macroeconomic policy

3.1 Optimising consumers and the Euler equation

Most models of consumption and savings are based upon the life 
cycle hypothesis originally developed by Franco Modigliani and 
collaborators (see for example Modigliani and Brumberg (1954), Modigliani (1966), and Modigliani (1986)
). While the life cycle hypothesis, and the related permanent 
income hypothesis, of Friedman (1957)represented considerable 
advances on previous naïve theories of consumption and saving, 
and apparently generated insights into questions such as why 
savings rates are no higher in rich countries than poor and also 
why savings will increase[footnote:
Although this finding is widely cited and is technically true, it 
will be shown in a later section of this paper that growth (due 
to technical progress or of population) cannot account for 
observed savings rates in Modigliani style life–cycle models.
] in a growing economy (see Deaton (2005) for an excellent 
review), it is explicitly anchored in the paradigm of a typical 
typical rational consumer maximising expected utility over their 
lifetime. This model, indeed, continues to dominate economic 
theorising (because it is mathematically tractable and taps into 
deep seated popular narratives regarding interest rates, saving 
and investment[footnote:
The argument is that the analysis of the relationships between 
savings, investment and interest rate has been distorted by what  
would term as ‘narratives’. These are powerful stories which 
subtly influence theoretical and empirical approaches to the 
relationship between these key macroeconomic variables. The key 
stories are i) that interest is the reward for waiting, or for 
deferring consumption; ii) savings are required for investment 
and therefore at a macroeconomic level a lack of savings can be 
constraint to growth and development; iii) the long–run real 
interest rate is determined by the balance between desired 
ex–ante saving and desired (ex–ante) investment.
]), despite the fact that it is well established that the 
optimisation problems required to be solved by consumers are both 
impossible (in behavioural terms) and far from observed reality 
(see Thaler (1994) and Thaler (2016)).

Most theories of consumption which form the micrcofoundations of 
macroeconomics start with the idea of the distribution of 
consumption through time being an inter-temporal optimisation 
problem for a ‘representative’ household which maximises utility 
based upon expected income and subjective trade-offs between 
present and future consumption (for example Deaton (1992), Romer (2018), Walsh (2017), and Galí (2015)
).

The models of consumption in orthodox theories characterise 
consumption decisions as intertemporal allocation decisions in 
which consumers maximise their utility, which is a function of 
consumption in every time period.

The fundamental argument here is that the canonical optimisation 
problem for consumers is not the one described in most textbooks, 
in which a consumer maximises utility subject to a budget 
constraint, and from which can be derived the narrative of 
consumption being inversely related to interest rates as 
summarised below:


   

   


Rather, the problem faced by individuals is how to minimise the 
probability that in any time period initial assets plus income 
will be insufficient (or unavailable) to maintain a socially 
determined minimum level of consumption. Conceptually, this could 
be characterised as individuals or households attempting to hold 
reserves of assets in order to maintain a minimum level of 
consumption in the event of income shocks (such as unemployment) 
or expenditure shocks (such as health or social care 
expenditures), as well as accumulating reserves to cover 
retirement, and or inability to work due to disability, 
sufficient to cover probable life expectancy.

This suggests the need to move from a framework of rational 
optimisation by homogeneous households (which is recognised to be 
both psychologically and computationally impossible) to a more 
realistic approach in which consumption and saving levels are 
socially determined and in which the psychological objectives of 
households (the avoidance of loss and destitution and the pursuit 
of power, for both of which there is empirical evidence) are 
realistic.

While there have been many critiques of the “rational” 
optimisation model of consumer behaviour,[footnote:
Among the earliest was the work of , which has very gradually led 
to the development of a considerable empirical literature, 
anchored in psychological science which suggests that the 
rational optimisation model is inconsistent with the 
computational abilities of the human mind, and with the actual 
way in which people take decisions (see for example ).
] this has tended to dominate orthodox discourse because of its 
mathematical tractability, even though it has relatively weak 
empirical support.

Theoretical and empirical work such as , and  have shown that 
rational consumer behaviour can be better explained through rules 
of thumb involving the use of buffer-stocks over relatively short 
periods (a few years) to cover unforeseen contingencies 
(particularly unemployment and health emergencies), while making 
some (often inadequate) provision for later years of life when 
little or no income will be available. This paper proposes an 
approach in which reasonable assumptions on individual 
consumption choices based upon modern behavioural theories, as 
opposed to unrealistic optimisation, are used to construct a 
plausible model of macroeconomic variables consistent with 
observed behaviour, broad consistent with the overall life-cycle 
hypothesis, but removing the assumption of optimisation at the 
centre of the hypothesis.

In this framework, those households which are able to, save 
essentially in order to avoid losses or destitution, including to 
provide resources for retirement. What this means in practice is 
that the principal motives for saving are the precautionary 
motive, whereby savings are needed to cushion unexpected falls in 
income (through unemployment for example), or unexpected 
expenditures on accidents and emergencies (particularly for 
health). It is explicitly recognised that individuals and 
households have little knowledge of the likely pattern of income 
over their lifetimes, and although they recognise that saving is 
necessary as a precautionary measure and eventually for 
retirement, there is little understanding of how much saving will 
be required over a life time. It is also recognised that in all 
economies a substantial proportion of the population will be 
unable to save enough to provide for short term emergencies[footnote:
Even in the US, the richest country in the world, in 2021, 40 
percent of households did not have money set aside for 
emergencies and would need to borrow, sell assets or draw on 
other savings to confront a loss of income from employment. 32 
percent of households had less than $400 for emergency expenses, 
while 24 percent had difficultly paying normal monthly bills .

Behavioral micro-foundations for macroeconomic policy

4.1 Reasonable, non-optimising consumers

In our framework, those households which are able to, save 
essentially in order to avoid catastrophe or destitution, 
including to provide resources for retirement, or to accumulate 
political and social power. What this means in practice is that 
the principal motives for saving are the precautionary motive, 
whereby savings are needed to cushion unexpected falls in income 
(through unemployment for example), or unexpected expenditures on 
accidents and emergencies (particularly for health), and for 
maintaining consumption during retirement, or for a few, as a 
means to obtaining and maintaining power. It is proposed to 
extend the framework to include three social groups divided 
broadly by income.

4.1.1 Low income earners

<lowincomeearners>

The first group is that of low income earners,[footnote:
In addition to low paid workers this group would include 
unemployed and under–employed households, self–employed (informal 
sector) as well as very small businesses. The criteria is the 
relationship of income to consumption needs rather than 
occupational status.
] in which income is insufficient (or only just sufficient) for 
physically and socially necessary consumption.[footnote:
By this is meant sufficient resources for all essential needs 
(such as food, clothing, housing, education and basic health 
care) as well as minimum contribution to social obligations, 
including contributions to community and family events and 
provision of support for extended family confronting emergencies.
] Net saving will be close to zero. Even if some individuals are 
temporarily able to make small savings for contingencies, as 
necessities will be met through social and family links, and 
accumulated savings of one individual will often be called upon 
to meet emergency expenditures of family or friends (see for 
example Banerjee and Duflo (2011, Chapter 9)). In the absence (or 
inadequacy) of public social welfare, those unable to work due to 
unemployment or old age, for example, will also be supported by 
family or informal social networks.

4.1.2 Middle income earners

<middleincomeearners>

The second group is that of middle income earners who generally 
have sufficient resources for basic necessities but has to plan 
and save for contingencies and retirement, and therefore net 
savings will be dependent on a combination of demographic 
factors, risk aversity, income levels, and the availability of 
public social protection and health services. It is not 
suggested, however, that households in this category will be 
making impossible decisions to optimise consumption over their 
lifetimes in a radically uncertain world, but rather will be 
taking reasonable decisions to try and avoid major shocks to 
their life-style and social standing. This would include having 
resources available to meet moderate contingencies and not being 
put into the position of losing one’s house, becoming bankrupt or 
having to make major reductions in expenditure over an extended 
time.

The choice between consumption and saving could be seen as one in 
which the benefits of immediate consumption are weighed against 
future risks and the security provided by increasing the pool of 
savings or assets.[footnote:
This is similar to the approach of  who showed that simply 
examining the trade–off between assets and consumption was an 
effective control mechanism to enable survival and under certain 
assumptions obtain an outcome not very different from the 
impossible constrained optimisation of traditional theory.
] However this calculus should not be seen in terms of the 
‘rational’ intertemporal optimisation. The perceived risks and 
the value of security of assets will be subjective and subject to 
waves of fear and optimism, as households receive new information 
and are infected by the opinions, fears and optimism of others. 
This inherent instability was central to Keynes idea of the 
fundamental uncertainty having a real and lasting impact on the 
real economy:

Actually, however, we have, as a rule, only the vaguest idea of 
any but the most direct consequences of our acts. Sometimes we 
are not much concerned with their remoter consequences, even tho 
time and chance may make much of them. But sometimes we are 
intensely concerned with them, more so, occasionally, than with 
the immediate consequences. Now of all human activities which are 
affected by this remoter preoccupation, it happens that one of 
the most important is economic in character, namely, Wealth. The 
whole object of the accumulation of Wealth is to produce results, 
or potential results, at a comparatively distant, and sometimes 
at an indefinitely distant, date. Thus the fact that our 
knowledge of the future is fluctuating, vague and uncertain, 
renders Wealth a peculiarly unsuitable subject for the methods of 
the classical economic theory. This theory might work very well 
in a world in which economic goods were necessarily consumed 
within a short interval of their being produced. But it requires, 
I suggest, considerable amendment if it is to be applied to a 
world in which the accumulation of wealth for an indefinitely 
postponed future is an important factor; and the greater the 
proportionate part played by such wealth-accumulation the more 
essential does such amendment become.  

This approach to consumption and savings should not be 
interpreted to imply that consumption will be highly volatile. 
Rather it implies that consumption is unlikely to be affected by 
small (or large) changes in the interest rate or ‘rational’ 
intertemporal optimisation over a long and uncertain future.

4.1.3 Very high income earners

<veryhighincomeearners>

The third group is very high income earners who have considerably 
more income than necessary to satisfy basic necessities, are able 
to indulge in luxury consumption and accumulate wealth, and 
indirectly power. For this group (a combination of capitalists, 
rentiers and a few ‘workers’ with special talents and very high 
incomes), once consumption needs[footnote:
This is not a reference to needs in the literal sense, but rather 
socially determined consumption validating the wealth and status 
of the wealthy as in  or .
] have been satiated, the dominant motivation becomes the 
accumulation of wealth in order to exert power and influence. In 
this case, accumulated wealth, in addition to providing security, 
provides power over others, and, if unchecked, the ability to 
alter the rules of the game of the socio-economic system, in 
favour of those possessing the most wealth (see for example ). 
For the purposes of the current analysis, the important point 
here is that for this group, there is unlikely to be a 
significant correlation between income and consumption (see ). 
Changes in volatile income would be largely reflected in changes 
in savings rather than consumption.

Empirical work such as  and  suggest that in fact the top income 
percentile of the population in the US saves more than total 
investment, and that this high level of saving has not boosted 
levels of investment, but is offset by dissaving of the bottom 
50% of the income distribution. The very high levels of saving 
among the highest income levels considerably undermines any 
universal rational consumer optimisation model, as opposed to an 
approach based in social realities.

Clearly there is no sharp dividing line between each of the three 
groups and one would expect households on the border line between 
the poor and the middle class, or between the rich and the middle 
class to exhibit behaviour characteristic of a mixture of the two 
groups. This will not have any significant effect on our 
analysis.

What is important, however, is that the savings and investment 
behaviour (as well as the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary 
policy) of economies will be determined by the relative sizes of 
each of these groups in the economy, and on the extent to which 
fiscal and monetary policies have differing impacts on each of 
the groups. For example. increases in taxation on the poor 
(particularly through indirect taxation) will simply reduce 
income and consumption (but cannot affect savings, as these will 
remain at zero). On the middle class taxation is likely to reduce 
both consumption and saving, while on the rich taxation should 
affect only saving given the independence of consumption from 
incomes. Similarly, public expenditure is likely to stimulate 
demand far more when directed towards the poorest than the most 
wealthy strata of society.

The fundamental argument here is that the canonical optimisation 
problem for consumers is not the one described in most textbooks 
and outlined in Section xxxx (Theories of consumption) on page 
xxx, in which a consumer maximises utility subject to a budget 
constraint, and from which can be derived the narrative of 
consumption being inversely related to interest rates as 
summarised below:


   


Rather, the problem faced by individuals is how to minimise the 
probability that in any time period initial assets plus income 
will be insufficient (or unavailable) to maintain a socially 
determined minimum level of consumption. Conceptually, this could 
be characterised as individuals or households attempting to hold 
reserves of assets in order to maintain a minimum level of 
consumption in the event of income shocks (such as unemployment) 
or expenditure shocks (such as health or social care 
expenditures), as well as accumulating reserves to cover 
retirement, and or inability to work due to disability, 
sufficient to cover probable life expectancy. Nevertheless, in 
the US in 2021, 40 percent of households did not have money set 
aside for emergencies and would need to borrow, sell assets or 
draw on other savings to confront a loss of income from 
employment. 32 percent of households had less than $400 for 
emergency expenses, while 24 percent had difficultly paying 
normal monthly bills .

This suggests that once we move from a framework of rational 
optimisation by homogeneous households (which is recognised to be 
both psychologically and computationally impossible) to a more 
realistic approach in which consumption and saving levels are 
socially determined and in which the psychological objectives of 
households (the avoidance of loss and destitution and the pursuit 
of power, for both of which there is empirical evidence) are 
realistic, the macroeconomic impact of fiscal and monetary policy 
cannot be usefully explained though changes in the size of the 
public sector deficit or surplus, the ratio of debt to GDP, nor 
through changes in short-term interest rates. In each case an 
analysis of how the policies would impact the consumption and 
investment of each of the three broad groups, described above, 
would be necessary to evaluate their overall macroeconomic 
impact.

4.1.3.1 The demand for financial assets

<thedemandforfinancialassets>

Once we reject the central axiom of orthodox economics that 
consumer behaviour is governed by the desire to maximise utility 
over time and across generations,[footnote:
An impossible task computationally and, more importantly, 
conceptually, in the face of radical uncertainty.
] and replace it with the notion of individuals acquiring 
financial assets as a form of insurance for the future without, 
necessarily, saving for specific purposes of future consumption, 
it becomes possible to talk about a demand for financial assets, 
per se, which have a value for the individual.

This contrasts significantly from the orthodox view, as 
expressed, for example, in one of the leading textbooks of 
advanced macroeconomics:

At a more general level, the basic idea of the permanent-income 
hypothesis is a simple insight about saving: saving is future 
consumption. As long as an individual does not save just for the 
sake of saving, he or she saves to consume in the future. The 
saving may be used for conventional consumption later in life, or 
bequeathed to the individual’s children for their consumption, or 
even used to erect monuments to the individual upon his or her 
death. But as long as the individual does not value saving in 
itself, the decision about the division of income between 
consumption and saving is driven by preferences between present 
and future consumption and information about future consumption 
prospects.  

The view of individuals acquiring financial assets for the 
purposes of security and insurance is not incompatible with many 
aspects of existing consumption theory. In particular, tendencies 
to smooth income, and to save for retirement, with lower savings 
rates for young populations, would be entirely consistent with 
the notion of a specific demand for financial assets. What would 
not be compatible would be the notion that changes to fiscal 
policy would have an impact on the private sector through 
anticipation of higher or lower taxes on future generations as 
suggested in the Ricardian equivalence literature, stemming from 
.

The impact of fiscal policy on a closed economy could be 
described as one in which the private sector has a net demand for 
financial assets,[footnote:
This net demand for financial assets could conceivably be 
negative, although in most growing economies is likely to to be 
positive. In this context we are only referring to effective 
demand for financial assets, by individuals or institutions, 
which gradually increase stocks over time, by a process of 
spending less than income.
] while the public sector supplies financial assets through 
public deficits or contracts their supply through public 
surpluses. ‘Equilibrium’ in this ‘market’ is then obtained 
through increases and decreases in income.

If the private sector is demanding, in aggregate, an increase in 
financial assets, by spending less than it receives, at full 
employment of national resources, the public sector must supply 
those financial assets in the form of an equivalent public sector 
deficit. If the public sector fails to supply the assets 
demanded, because it is implementing a (relatively) tight fiscal 
policy,[footnote:
In this case fiscal policy is tight only relative to demand for 
financial assets. Thus, if the private sector is ‘demanding’ new 
financial assets of 4 per cent of GDP, a deficit of 3 per cent of 
GDP could be considered tight. It will also be seen later (in 
section xxx) that the tightness of fiscal policy would also need 
to be measured with reference to the structure of public revenues 
and expenditure, and not only the volume of the deficit or 
surplus.
] the result will be that income decreases until private sector 
demand for financial assets, contracts to the level of supply of 
public financial assets. Similarly, if the public deficit is 
greater than the demand for private sector financial assets and 
full employment of resources, incomes will tend to increase, if 
necessary through inflation, until the private demand for 
financial assets rises to meet the public sector deficit.

In this framework it makes no sense to talk about the private 
sector anticipating future taxes to repay current deficits.[footnote:
The idea of the private sector offsetting the fiscal stance (the 
Ricardian equivalence hypothesis) depends fundamentally on the 
axiom of individuals maximising life time utility from 
consumption.
] The financing requirements of the public sector in the future 
depend on the a large number of complex real variables, including 
the future demographic structure of the population, the future 
volume and structure of investment, the nature of the future 
social contract and provisions for welfare, unemployment and 
health insurance, and indeed the nature, timing and outcomes of 
future wars. These are to all intents and purposes radically 
uncertain and unknowable.

4.5 A taxonomy of inflation - a return to first principles

In the previous discussions of the the different approaches of 
macroeconomic policy for economic stabilisation there were 
implicitly various potentially contradictory explanations for 
inflation. The monetarist explanation implies that it is a purely 
monetary phenomenon, whereas cost push explanations (or supply 
shocks) might indicate that the roots of inflation are in the 
structure of the economy (particularly in the Latin American 
structural tradition, which places emphasis on the importance of 
social and economic structures, and the existence of bottlenecks 
in key sectors[footnote:
Need some references here.xxxx
]). There are also arguments suggesting that inflation is largely 
a fiscal phenomenon (although such arguments implicitly have a 
monetary component as well).

4.6 A theory of inflation

Orthodox theories of inflation begin with the assumption that 
there is a set of relative prices which would constitute an 
equilibrium for the economy, and that without further changes in 
preferences, technology, knowledge, all agents would be 
satisfied, and there would be no pressures on prices to change. 
In practice, of course, all the exogenous determinants of the 
system are changing on a daily basis, and so there will never be 
a stationary vector of prices to ‘solve’ the system of general 
equilibrium equations. Nevertheless, it would not be unreasonable 
to assume that agents in a general equilibrium system would be 
able to judge in which direction prices would need to change in 
order to resolve excesses of supply and demand in specific 
markets. This indeed is the central heuristic of neoclassical 
economics and monetary explanations of inflation. As was 
discussed previously, the implicit theory of inflation is then 
derived by appealing to the ‘classical dichotomy’ is to explain 
the level of prices (and thus the rate of inflation) as being a 
purely monetary phenomenon.

There are a number of problems with this framework for the 
determination of relative prices, however. The first is that 
economic agents (people and enterprises) simply accept the gains 
and losses implied by changes in relative prices. While gains 
will of course be accepted, losses are likely to be strongly 
resisted. The second problem is that it assumes that agents’ 
behaviour is governed by the rational maximisation of utility. 
Finally, it is assumed that they have the cognitive ability to 
perform such a maximisation. Behavioural economics literature [footnote:
For example, see Simon (1955), Simon (1956), Kahneman and Tversky (1979), Kahneman (2002), Kahneman (2003), Thaler (2016), and Thaler (2018)
 and many others.
] has clearly demonstrated that these three axioms of behaviour 
do not represent the way individuals make choices and cannot 
therefore form a satisfactory basis for macroeconomic theory.

Rather than viewing inflation as a monetary phenomenon it is more 
useful to view it as a conflict over the allocation of resources. 
In this view there will be a number of competing factors which 
determine the levels of inflationary pressure in the economy. On 
the one hand increasing productivity and labour force 
participation will tend to decrease inflationary pressures (by 
making more resources available for distribution), while a 
deterioration (improvement) in the terms of trade will increase 
(decrease) inflationary pressures. Similarly, devaluation 
(revaluation) of the real exchange rate will increase (decrease) 
inflationary pressures. 

Equally, excess aggregate demand allows agents in some sectors to 
increase their command over resources, by raising relevant prices 
(including wages). However, whether they will do so and whether 
this will result in sustained inflation will depend of a set of 
factors to be discussed below.

The question then is: if agents are not (and cannot be) 
mechanically optimising resources, how are prices and inflation 
determined. To say that agents are not rational optimisers 
setting marginal productivity and marginal desire for leisure 
equal to prices and wages, does not mean that price setting for 
many goods and services will not respond to the forces of ‘supply 
and demand’. Rather the argument is that since, in many cases, 
the marginal calculations are impossible, the setting of prices 
and wages will rely substantially on convention and historically 
established notions of fairness. 

4.6.1 Investment decisions

4.6.2 Influence of interest rates on investment



Alternative theories of the role of the rate of interest

It will be clear from the above arguments that there is little 
role for the rate of interest to perform an to equilibrate 
savings and investment in the economy. Indeed, as discussed 
previously, the idea that an increase in the rate of interest 
could increase savings and therefore investment and growth is 
both logically and empirically unfounded.

There is a wealth of empirical evidence suggesting that saving is 
insensitive to changes in interest rates. Monetary policy 
(largely through interest rate movements) may have affects on 
private consumption and investment decisions. However, once one 
removes the axiom of the maximisation of intertemporal utility as 
the dominant motivation for consumers, the scope for interest 
rates to affect private consumption decisions is considerably 
diminished. This is consistent with the empirical literature 
[cite sources] on the relatively low elasticity of consumption to 
interest rates.

Whether interest rates will affect private consumption 
significantly will depend very much on the institutional 
framework for consumption. In an economy in which a large part of 
the population buys houses on mortgages (particularly variable 
rate mortgages), there is no doubt that interest rates will 
affect income and consumption, both through the purchase of new 
housing (which also drives a significant part of the consumer 
durable market) and through the income and wealth effects on 
existing borrowers, where a rise in the interest rate will act as 
a tax on the borrower’s income and (over time) reduce the 
perceived value of assets (such as property). However, those 
parts of the population who are credit constrained or holders of 
financial assets will, in the former case, be insensitive to 
interest rate changes, and in the latter, have a positive income 
effect for a rise in the interest rate. Thus the social and 
institutional structure will determine if there is any 
sensitivity of consumption to interest rate movements.

The relationship of physical investment to interest rates is also 
unlikely to be a smooth monotonic function. In the paradigm of 
the macroeconomic textbooks entrepreneurs have the choice of 
investing in numerous projects with a well defined rate of return 
(possibly with a well defined variance around the expected rate 
of return). If the expected rate of return exceeds the interest 
rate (and the entrepreneur can secure the necessary capital - 
from borrowing, equity or own resources) the investment is likely 
to take place.

Hence, in this approach a fall in the (real) rate of interest 
will tend to raise the volume of investment, while a rise will 
diminish the volume of investment. There is little doubt that 
very high real rates of interest are effective in curtailing 
investment, and indeed severe monetary contractions can very 
quickly reduce investment levels, by raising enormously the risk 
of investment, in a moment when demand for final output is likely 
to fall. While the comparison of the relative returns on 
financial assets and physical investment may have some effect, 
there is little doubt that the principal effect of raising 
interest rates is to reduce the expected return of investment, 
through expected falls in aggregate demand. As discussed 
previously the likelihood of a very high variance of the rate of 
return on investment (particularly in countries with weak 
institutional structures), is also likely to reduce the 
elasticity of investment to the rate of interest.

Low rates of interest, however, may not have symmetric effects. 
While they may reduce slightly the costs of investment, they will 
not increase expected returns by as much as high rates depress 
expected returns. The experience of ultra-low interest rates 
since 2008 is perhaps the clearest illustration of this point. 
There has not been an extraordinary investment boom by historical 
standards. Nor have zero real or nominal rates suddenly made 
previously unviable investments viable, precisely because of the 
uncertainty over returns. What low interest rates have done is to 
raise asset prices, (property, shares, cryptocurrency, etc.), 
often purchased using cheap credit to leverage returns,[footnote:
This is the essence of Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, 
 which argues that financial crises are not aberrations or due to 
policy errors, but rather inherent characteristics of capitalist 
economies with financial markets.
] as wealth holders look for alternative (and often more risky) 
assets to produce a return. Over time the rise in asset prices 
may also contribute to raising consumption through wealth 
effects, at the expense of increasing the risks of reversing 
monetary policy, as evidenced by the economic crises of 2008 and 
2022.

All these considerations suggest that private expenditure on 
consumption and investment may be affected by monetary policy in 
an uncertain and unpredictable manner. The effects of monetary 
policy will depend upon changing views about the future, of both 
consumers and investors. They are unlikely to be linear or even 
monotonic. In these circumstances, while it may be possible to 
identify at a specific moment in time an interest rate which will 
be consistent with full employment of resources at a low 
inflation rate, there will be nothing natural or stable about 
this interest rate, and indeed, in many circumstances it may not 
exist. There is no reason that a natural interest rate should 
exist (see Clarke (1996)) once we dispense with the idea that 
interest rates in some sense reflect a trade-off between present 
and future consumption for consumers engaged in an exercise of 
intertemporal utility maximisation, or that it is related to the 
real (unknowable) return to physical capital.

5.1 A brief history of theories of the interest rate

One of the key narratives in economics is that of the natural or 
neutral rate of interest. This idea was first formulated by 
Wicksell in the following statement:

“There is a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in 
respect to commodity prices, and tends neither to raise nor to 
lower them. This is necessarily the same as the rate of interest 
which would be determined by supply and demand if no use were 
made of money and all lending were effected in the form of real 
capital goods. It comes to much the same thing to describe it as 
the current value of the natural rate of interest on capital.” Wicksell (1936, p. 102)
 

Summers makes the explicit connection with Wicksell’s in his 
discussion of secular stagnation:

“Excess savings tend to drive interest rates down, and excess 
investment demand tends to drive them up. Following the Swedish 
economist Knut Wicksell, it is common to refer to the real 
interest rate that balances saving and investment at full 
employment as the ‘natural’ or ‘neutral’ real interest rate.” Summers (2016, p. 4)
 

In this formulation the ‘natural’ rate of interest is equivalent 
to the unobservable return to physical capital. The idea is that 
when the observable money rate of interest is equal to this 
return on capital there will be no pressure on prices (either 
upwards or downwards). The notion is very similar to that adopted 
by monetary policy makers currently. For example, in a speech on 
the challenges of monetary policy Jerome Powell notes that:

“the general level of interest rates has fallen both here in the 
United States and around the world. Estimates of the neutral 
federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent with the economy 
operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen 
substantially, in large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium 
real interest rate, or ‘r-star’. This rate is not affected by 
monetary policy but instead is driven by fundamental factors in 
the economy, including demographics and productivity growth–the 
same factors that drive potential economic growth.” Powell (2020) 

The idea of the ‘neutral’ rate of interest in monetary policy, is 
very close to Wicksell’s, and in Powell’s formulation the central 
goal of monetary policy is to set interest rates at this neutral 
rate, which is consistent with full employment and price 
stability, and determined by macroeconomic fundamentals, in the 
real economy. The quote from Powell’s speech also illustrates how 
a falling neutral rate of interest may be seen as both a symptom 
and a cause of secular stagnation.[footnote:
See for example . The declining neutral rate is attributed to 
factors such as demographics and relatively cheap capital, but 
also contributes to secular stagnation by reducing the room for 
monetary policy to correct the stagnation due to the implied 
lower bound on nominal interest rates.

In Wicksell’s formulation, there was the implicit assumption that 
of the natural tendency for an economy to full employment through 
endogenous price (including interest rate) adjustments.

5.1.1 Liquidity preference and loanable funds

<liquiditypreferenceandloanablefunds>

Since the publication of Keynes General Theory there has been 
considerable debate as to the role and determination of the rate 
of interest. The issue has revolved around whether the interest 
rate is the price of liquidity or whether in some sense it is set 
in the market for the supply and demand for loanable funds (which 
is often - incorrectly - conflated with the supply and demand for 
savings to finance investment).

The issue was broadly considered as a distraction following Hicks 
apparent demonstration that the two theories were formally 
equivalent, in that in a Walrasian general equilibrium system by 
Walras’ law one market was necessarily redundant, and so that if 
one eliminated the market for loans or bonds, the rate of 
interest was the price of money (as in the liquidity preference 
theory) while if one eliminated the money market the rate of 
interest becomes the price of bonds (as in the loanable funds 
theory). (See  and further discussion in .)

It was (reputedly) commented by Abba Lerner that if one could 
eliminate any market from the Walrasian system, what would happen 
if one eliminated the market for peanuts. Would we have a peanut 
theory of interest? (See ). Behind this possibly apocryphal 
comment there is a serious issue. One cannot simply eliminate 
from the Walrasian system any market, if that market is either 
too small or has close substitutes. Indeed, most generic 
macroeconomic models of Walrasian general equilibrium only have a 
few markets (such as money, bonds, labour, goods, foreign 
exchange). Although theoretically a full Walrasian general 
equilibrium may have thousands of markets for each possible 
commodity, type of labour, and financial instrument, in practice 
it makes little sense to have equations for each market, 
particularly when it a close substitute for other markets.

In the case of the market for money, loans and bonds, one could 
treat these as all relatively close substitutes which constitute 
a generic commodity of financial assets, which is desired in and 
of itself, which is required for the provision of security 
against hazards and destitution. This commodity (net financial 
assets) can only be acquired, through the difference between 
income and net expenditure on goods and services.

In this case there is no market to eliminate and the rate of 
interest (or rather the vector of rates of interest in the 
economy) becomes the relative price to distinguish financial 
assets from a pure medium of exchange money.

5.2 Interest as an expression of time preference

5.3 The rate of interest and the return to capital

One of the questions which might arise is how is it possible for 
the rate of interest to differ (persistently) from the rate of 
return to capital. The answer is simply that the rate of return 
to capital is not known ex-ante. Thus if the ex-post rate of 
return to capital were to rise, this might well raise the 
incentive to invest. However, investors have no means of knowing 
that the rate of return to capital for new investments will be 
equal to the observed ex-post rate of return. Moreover, the 
return on any particular investment will be very uncertain, given 
that the ex-post return to capital is likely to have a very large 
variance, and include investments which have returns of several 
orders of magnitude greater than the mean, as well as investments 
which have strongly negative returns. In these circumstance there 
can be no mechanism which will tend to equalise money rates of 
interest to the returns to physical investment.

It would also be the case that investment would not be very 
sensitive to changes in interest rates, but much more to the 
availability of credit. A change in the rate of interest, if 
credit is available, would simply make a small difference to the 
risk of losses from the investment (which behavioural theory[footnote:
See for example the empirical work on loss aversion: 
] would suggest is one of the main factors in determining whether 
an investment will be carried out or not). On the other hand the 
availability, or otherwise, of credit at whatever interest rate, 
could determine the feasibility of an investment.

In this section it is argued that the observed low savings rates 
in many developing countries are more likely to be the result of 
the low quality of investment - by this it is meant investment 
which includes a significant proportion of expenditure on 
‘capital’ which is not productive.  describes this phenomenon in 
great detail. In particular he notes that:

The value of capital and cost of investment will diverge ex post 
for at least three reasons: relative price shifts, technological 
changes, and mistakes. Since the value of a capital good depends 
on expected future prices, not fully anticipated changes in 
relative prices will change the value of capital goods. These 
changes in relative prices can stem either from terms of trade 
changes or from policy reforms (for example, a decline in value 
of capital equipment devoted to import substitution following 
tariff reductions). Technological innovations create a process of 
‘creative destruction’ that reduces the value of existing capital 
stocks that embody old techniques due to innovation. Finally, 
even though private investors equate costs and expected value, 
when investing the private sector often makes (large) mistakes. 
The private sector will have its share of ex post white elephants 
either through underestimating costs or overestimating potential 
profits.  

The implicit assumption in all analyses of productivity and 
capital accumulation in economies is that capital is accumulated 
in each sector (s) of an economy is given by the following 
equation:


   


Where K_{t}^{s} is the capital stock in time t of sector s and \delta^{s}
 is the rate of annual depreciation in sector s, while I_{t}^{s} 
is investment in sector s for time period t. The sectors could 
represent public and private sectors or different economic 
sectors of the economy. Thus, summing across sectors, the 
productive capital stock of the economy is given by:


   


However, the above presumes that all investment has produced 
productive capital, or in other words the value of the capital 
created is the cost of the initial investment, and that no 
investment is wasted or unfinished. This assumption would appear 
to be quite unwarranted, but as Pritchett notes, never stated or 
challenged in empirical work on capital, growth and development. 
Immediately one considers the enormous number of investments, 
both public and private, which are either never finished or are 
soon abandoned, once their economic unviability becomes apparent, 
it is clear that any definition of capital based upon Cumulated 
Depreciated Investment Effort (CUDIE), as Pritchett terms it, is 
likely to be wrong by orders of magnitude for most developing 
countries. Erroneous estimates of capital from such methods 
contribute to convoluted debates to explain how Total Factor 
Productivity declines in many countries over significant periods 
of time.[footnote:
See for example  for discussions of these issues in the cases of 
Mexico and Brazil. In addition  shows that 55% of developing 
countries have negative total TFP growth over the thirty year 
period from 1960 to 1990 using the standard formulation of 
capital accumulation from Equation ([eqn:cudie]).
]

An alternative formulation is to include in the calculation of 
the accumulated capital a factor \gamma  to represent the 
difference between investment effort I_{t}^{s} and investment 
which results in the creation of capital, as follows:


   


In this formulation, \gamma_{t}^{s} could vary between one and 
zero, with a value of one implying that investment was of 
‘maximum’ quality, with all investment leading to the creation of 
productive capital at market prices, and zero implying that 
investment effort led to no creation of productive capital.

While traditionally \gamma  has been assumed to be unity, thus 
allowing the estimation of TFP growth from a capital stock 
calculated as a perpetual inventory, using the Solow growth 
equation, Pritchett makes an assumption of positive TFP growth 
(1%) to calculate the implied value of \gamma , which is the 
proportion of investment effort actually converted into 
productive capital. The results of the calculations suggest that

5.4 Equilibration of savings and investment

One of the most common diagnoses of slow growth and lack of 
development is a low savings ratio. Low savings are said to lead 
to inadequate finance for investment and thus constrain 
development. Low savings rates are often attributed to financial 
repression (controlled interest rates) or the underdevelopment of 
financial institutions discouraging financial intermediation.

This explanation is supported by the narrative in which the lack 
of savings raises market interest rates, while government 
intervention to lower interest rates distorts the process of 
capital allocation and financial intermediation by the banking 
and financial system. It sounds very plausible and fits in with 
the standard orthodox approach in which almost economists are 
trained. It is, however, an explanation which is not logically 
consistent, and also which does not have an empirical basis.

The logical inconsistency can be seen very clearly by means of 
two thought experiments. In the first we consider an economy with 
low saving and investment. An effective measure is taken to 
encourage saving.[footnote:
It is not clear what the nature of such a measure would be. 
Policy makers have been notoriously unsuccessful in finding 
levers to increase savings.
] Consumers reduce their expenditure and deposit the non-consumed 
funds in the banking system. The banking system, however, has no 
additional liquidity, as every peso, rupee or real deposited by 
consumers constitutes a reduction in funds held by producers in 
the banking system.

The second thought experiment is the following: suppose the 
authorities take measures to increase confidence in the banking 
system. Suppose further that the result of these measures is to 
encourage the deposit of hoarded funds and or precious metals 
with the banking system. In this case, the banks will have 
additional liquidity and the ability to lend, without there 
having been any change in savings. In effect if investment is 
constrained by a lack of lending, this cannot be solved by 
increasing saving. If an increase in lending allows an increase 
in investment, in a economy employed at full capacity, then 
clearly there will be macroeconomic consequences to the increase 
in investment, in the form of inflation and or an increase in the 
deficit of the current account of the balance of payments. 
Inflation would reduce both ex-ante consumption and investment to 
levels consistent with capacity, while the increased balance of 
payments deficit would imply additional external financing. In 
both cases investment would be higher than in the previous 
situation, without an increase in the propensity of households 
and producers to save.

5.4.1 Why are investment and savings rates low in some countries?

<whyareinvestmentandsavingsrateslowinsomecountries>

If a low propensity to save cannot logically be a cause of low 
investment and growth, then it is important to provide a coherent 
explanation for the observed cases of low savings and investment. 
It is often presumed that, particularly in developing countries, 
the distance from the technological frontier, and the relative 
lack of capital, implies that there must be many highly 
profitable investment opportunities with returns that far exceed 
those in the most developed countries. The fact that investment 
levels are often lower in developing countries and that capital 
often flows from poorer to richer countries[footnote:
See the debate on the paradox of capital flows which started with 
.
] suggests that it is necessary to examine the factors 
determining the level of investment.

The first question is whether profitable investment opportunities 
exist, at least in principle. By this we mean that if an investor 
were to secure the physical capital, do the necessary inputs, in 
the form of labour, raw materials and other inputs, exist to 
produce saleable output with a positive return on the capital. 
The answer in almost all countries to this question must be 
positive. Indeed it is this positive answer that is the basis of 
the paradox of capital flows from poor countries to rich ones, 
and also the reason that, for many decades, development was 
simply seen as a question of making the necessary capital 
available to developing countries, in order to realise the 
returns technically available. This was the consequence of the 
narrative which suggested that if investment opportunities exist, 
these will be seen by entrepreneurs and investment will be 
forthcoming if the finance is available. The absence of such 
investment in many cases was ascribed to the lack of finance (or 
the lack of savings).

This narrative, however, ignored four far more important 
questions.

1. The first of these is often a basic lack of knowledge (or 
  managerial know-how) among potential entrepreneurs about which 
  are viable investments. The result is that many investments 
  fail, and that the return on capital is not a tight 
  distribution around a well defined mean but rather a 
  distribution with a very large variance in which the most 
  successful investments may have returns in triple digits, while 
  a substantial majority have very low and in many cases negative 
  returns. This problem can be mitigated (but certainly not 
  eliminated) through effective banking institutions, with good 
  governance, where the key role is not so much the 
  transformation of short term deposits into long term lending 
  but rather, the scrutiny of investment proposals (see the 
  discussion below).

2. A second fundamental issue is the ‘governance environment’ of 
  investment. Do there exist the institutions which protect 
  investments and their returns from predatory behaviour by 
  private competitors, politicians and state institutions? This 
  is more than a question of pro-forma respect for property 
  rights, but concerns the issue of whether economically and 
  politically powerful actors are constrained by the rule of law. 
  If they are not, the volume of desired investment is likely to 
  be restricted or directed into rent extraction rather than 
  wealth creation.

3. Thirdly, there are the traditional constraints to investment - 
  the existence of quality infrastructure (particularly transport 
  and energy) and a well qualified labour force. These will play 
  an important role in determining which investments may be 
  technically and economically viable.

4. Finally there is the issue of the effectiveness of the banking 
  and financial system. It is clearly possible that viable 
  investments requiring credit may be turned down by banks or 
  other financial institutions, or indeed by the individual 
  holders of financial assets. This may be because of information 
  asymmetry between the investor and the lender, or risk aversion 
  of the lender, an inability of the lender to identify the 
  difference between viable and non-viable projects, or possibly 
  political or sectoral criteria used by the lender to identify 
  potential investments. Any of these factors would reduce the 
  volume of investment in viable activities, and potentially 
  increase the volume of investment in non-viable activities.

The level and quality of viable investment will thus be 
determined by these four factors, which are likely to dominate 
the prospects of returns.

5.4.2 The quality of investment

<thequalityofinvestment>

In this section it is argued that the observed low savings rates 
in many developing countries are more likely to be the result of 
the low quality of investment - by this it is meant investment 
which includes a significant proportion of expenditure on 
‘capital’ which is not productive.  describes this phenomenon in 
great detail for the public sector. In particular he notes that:

The value of capital and cost of investment will diverge ex post 
for at least three reasons: relative price shifts, technological 
changes, and mistakes. Since the value of a capital good depends 
on expected future prices, not fully anticipated changes in 
relative prices will change the value of capital goods. These 
changes in relative prices can stem either from terms of trade 
changes or from policy reforms (for example, a decline in value 
of capital equipment devoted to import substitution following 
tariff reductions). Technological innovations create a process of 
‘creative destruction’ that reduces the value of existing capital 
stocks that embody old techniques due to innovation. Finally, 
even though private investors equate costs and expected value, 
when investing the private sector often makes (large) mistakes. 
The private sector will have its share of ex post white elephants 
either through underestimating costs or overestimating potential 
profits.  

The implicit assumption in all analyses of productivity and 
capital accumulation in economies is that capital is accumulated 
in each sector (s) of an economy is given by the following 
equation:


   


Where K_{t}^{s} is the capital stock in time t of sector s and \delta^{s}
 is the rate of annual depreciation in sector s, while I_{t}^{s} 
is investment in sector s for time period t. The sectors could 
represent public and private sectors or different economic 
sectors of the economy. Thus, summing across sectors, the 
productive capital stock of the economy is given by:


   


However, the above presumes that all investment has produced 
productive capital, or in other words the value of the capital 
created is the cost of the initial investment, and that no 
investment is wasted or unfinished. This assumption would appear 
to be quite unwarranted, but as Pritchett notes, never stated or 
challenged in empirical work on capital, growth and development. 
Immediately one considers the enormous number of investments, 
both public and private, which are either never finished or are 
soon abandoned, once their economic unviability becomes apparent, 
it is clear that any definition of capital based upon Cumulated 
Depreciated Investment Effort (CUDIE), as Pritchett terms it, is

countries have negative total TFP growth over the thirty year 
period from 1960 to 1990 using the standard formulation of 
capital accumulation from Equation ([eqn:cudie]).
]

An alternative formulation is to include in the calculation of 
the accumulated capital a factor \gamma  to represent the 
difference between investment effort I_{t}^{s} and investment 
which results in the creation of capital, as follows:


   


In this formulation, \gamma_{t}^{s} could vary between one and 
zero, with a value of one implying that investment was of 
‘maximum’ quality, with all investment leading to the creation of 
productive capital at market prices, and zero implying that 
investment effort led to no creation of productive capital.

While traditionally \gamma  has been assumed to be unity, thus 
allowing the estimation of TFP growth from a capital stock 
calculated as a perpetual inventory, using the Solow growth 
equation , Pritchett makes an assumption of positive TFP growth 
(1%) to calculate the implied value of \gamma , which is the 
proportion of investment effort actually converted into 
productive capital. The results of the calculations suggest that 
in many countries the ‘effective’ capital stock is far below the 
traditionally measure one, and that much ‘investment’ which takes 
place does not have any value or generate any additional output 
or income.

5.4.3 The determination of the rate of growth

<thedeterminationoftherateofgrowth>

In previous sections it was shown how the savings rate could 
depend directly on the growth rate of the economy. It was also 
shown that traditional measures of investment and capital 
accumulation often fail to capture the volume of effectively 
wasted investment, which appears in the data as negative or very 
low growth of total factor productivity. This suggests that one 
of the principal factors determining growth rates is the quality 
of the public and private institutions underpinning the choice of 
investment.

If, in a relatively undeveloped country, public and private 
institutions emerge to ensure that i) public investment in 
infrastructure is effective and relevant to growth and ii) there 
is filter to ensure that private sector investment is broadly 
directed to productive goals and that ineffective investment is 
quickly eliminated, it possible to envisage a cycle in which 
investment quickly generates growth. The growth generates the 
necessary saving and thus finance is not the constraint of 
investment and growth. An examination of the countries which have 
managed to take-off in recent decades will show that these are 
the two critical factors.

5.5 Determination of the long term interest rate

5.6 Does there exist an equilibrium rate of interest?

All the above arguments depend on the idea that there exists a 
real rate of interest (positive or negative) that will be 
consistent with full employment of resources in the economy. This 
notion in turn implicitly relies upon the main aggregates of 
spending (investment and consumption) being monotonic and stable 
functions of the real rate of interest in which \frac{\partial I}{\partial r}<0
 and \frac{\partial C}{\partial r}<0. It is also implicit that 
the range of this ‘equilibrium’ real interest rate should be not 
very far from a low positive value. If it were to move outside 
accepted commonly accepted ranges, it is likely that the income 
and wealth effects of an ‘equilibrium’ rate of say -10% or +10% 
would destabilise any potential full employment equilibrium. 
Simply stating these conditions makes clear that the existence of 
a reasonable equilibrium real rate at all times is doubtful.

, for example, notes that in pure theory changes in interest 
rates produce both substitution and income effects and that 
consequently the direction of effects of changes in real interest 
rates on consumption are uncertain, and will certainly depend on 
the distribution of debts and credits throughout the economy. He 
also highlights the importance of the existence of 
Non-Reproducible Assets (NRAs)[footnote:
Palley gives examples of NRAs such as fiat money, precious metals 
and minerals, land, rent streams from firms with market power, 
and intellectual property such as patents and copyrights. To this 
list could be added crypto currencies and tokens. All have in 
common that, particularly in an era of low inflation and low 
(possibly negative) nominal interest rates, they can generate a 
return and substitute productive investment, due to their 
non–reproducibility.
] as substitutes for investment, which will impede the workings 
of the interest rate as a mechanism to equilibrate savings and 
investment. A further potential problem noted by Palley is that 
well known behavioural mechanisms such as the endowment effect , 
whereby negative (real or nominal) interest rates may encourage 
saving to replace lost financial assets. Econometrically one of 
the most robust determinants of private saving is the rate of 
inflation. In their analysis of 165 countries over the period 
1981–2012  find the following result:

Increased macroeconomic uncertainty, proxied by higher inflation, 
leads to increased private precautionary saving. An increase of 
inflation by one pp is associated with a 0.39 pp rise in the 
private saving rate. According to this result, the moderation of 
inflation rates observed around the world since the 1990s 
contributed to a decline in private saving.  

This would again seem to suggest a negative relationship between 
saving and real interest rates (at least in some circumstances), 
indicating a non-monotonic function in which, over some ranges \frac{\partial C}{\partial r}>0
.

Final point is that there is already a mechanism for investment 
and saving to equilibrate - that is changes in income

5.7 The weight of false narratives

This paper examines the theoretical and empirical approaches to 
the role of savings and investment in macroeconomic development, 
and suggests that the analysis of the relationships between 
savings, investment and interest rate has been distorted by what Shiller (2019) and Shiller (2021)
 would term as “narratives”. These are powerful stories which 
subtly influence theoretical and empirical approaches to the 
relationship between these key macroeconomic variables. The key 
stories are i) that interest is the reward for waiting, or for 
deferring consumption; ii) savings are required for investment 
and therefore at a macroeconomic level a lack of savings can be 
constraint to growth and development; iii) the long-run real 
interest rate is determined by the balance between desired 
ex-ante saving and desired (ex-ante) investment. It will be 
argued that

  of capital

5.8.3 Interest rates and demand management



A behavioural approach to fiscal policy

The natural or neutral rate of interest conceptually is the 
solution to the system of Walrasian general equilibrium equations 
which would hypothetically maintain the economy at a full 
employment equilibrium, if nothing else ever changes. The 
equilibrium is never (and can never be) achieved, as it depends 
upon the existence of smooth convex preferences, and rational 
maximisation of utility by omniscient economic agents. In 
addition, and most importantly for this discussion, the ‘general 
equilibrium’ will depend upon the fiscal stance.

This point can be illustrated in a very schematic way as follows. 
Consider the case in which the Government has no budget deficit 
and finances all spending from taxation. An interest rate r^{*}, 
consistent with full employment and low inflation has been found. 
If the government then reduces (increases) expenditure without 
changing the rate of taxation a budget surplus (deficit) will 
emerge and aggregate demand will fall below (rise above) the full 
employment equilibrium. In the new situation the interest rate r^{*}
 would no longer be the neutral interest rate and policy makers 
would have to search for a lower (higher) natural interest rate 
to achieve full employment with low inflation.[footnote:
This assumes that in the new situation such an interest rate 
exists, once the non–linearities of the interest rate function on 
consumption, investment and asset prices are taken into account.
]

Another way of examining the issue is to recall the discussion of 
the demand for financial assets in section xxxx. A situation of 
insufficient demand with downward pressure on prices would 
normally induce the monetary authorities to lower interest rates 
until demand is raised.[footnote:
The experience of the past two decades indicates that the 
combination of the potential zero lower bound on nominal interest 
rates, with non–linearities in the interest rate expenditure 
functions, it may be difficult to find a rate of interest 
consistent with full employment.
] This is, however, equivalent to saying that at full employment 
there is a net demand for financial assets by the private sector, 
which requires a public sector deficit[footnote:
The alternative is that a balance of payments surplus is 
generated by investment in export industries to allow the 
accumulation of external financial assets. This process, however, 
is unlikely to take place quickly and smoothly.
] to supply them.

In the Walrasian (or Arrow-Debreu) general equilibrium approach , 
there cannot be a ‘demand’ for financial assets as such, as we 
saw in the quote from Romer in section xxx orthodox macroeconomic 
theory excludes the possibility of saving being valued by 
individuals in itself. In the approach proposed in this paper, 
individuals do value saving /financial assets, in themselves, as 
security against an uncertain future. Simply changing the 
interest rate will not significantly alter this demand. Financial 
assets (which are not needed in a general equilibrium model) can 
only be acquired as the difference between income and 
expenditure.

6.1 Alternative Policy Frameworks

<alternativepolicyframeworks>

The previous arguments suggest an alternative institutional and 
policy framework might be possible. It is clear that raising 
interest rates sufficiently can choke off investment (not mainly 
through a rationally calculated rate of return calculation), but 
rather by increasing the risks of adverse outturns, particularly 
if others reduce investment levels. However, there is little 
theoretical or empirical support for the idea that reducing short 
term interest rates below the inflation target and possibly to 
zero or negative levels in nominal terms will have a substantial 
effect in stimulating physical investment (speculative financial 
investment is another matter). Certainly lowering rates will have 
little impact on consumption through the mechanism of rationally 
chosen time preference for consumption. It is arguable that even 
raising interest rates will only have an effect on consumption 
indirectly, by acting as a signal of greater uncertainty and 
risks, generating narratives of fear of unemployment and coming 
austerity requiring increased holdings of financial assets. In 
other words increasing interest rates may only raise savings by 
increasing fear and uncertainty.

Thus if at low rates of interest there is insufficient demand and 
a tendency towards deflation in the economy, lowering interest 
rates will not have a symmetric effect with raising interest 
rates to reduce excess demand. In effect, it might be said that 
low demand at low interest rates is symptomatic of a desire by 
the private sector to accumulate financial assets, which can only 
be supplied by an increase in the public sector deficit.

Traditionally, it has been suggested that responding to such a 
situation through fiscal policy will suffer from the following 
problems:

1. Increased expenditure or reduced taxes require time to be put 
  into effect

2. The quality of spending will be low without adequate 
  evaluation

3. Increased spending or lower taxes are difficult to reverse

(see reasons in Fiscal Policy and EMU)

In order to overcome these obstacles it would be necessary to 
have in place a symmetric institutional structure to be able to 
quickly increase and reduce transfers to the population. This 
could be established through a universal unconditional income 
transfer, whereby base income will always be transferred and 
temporary additional income transfers made at times of 
insufficient demand, while short-term interest rates have a floor 
equal to the inflation target. The result of such a system would 
be to use restrictive monetary policy to combat excess demand and 
expansionary fiscal policy to deal with insufficient demand.



A behavioural approach to monetary policy

7.1 Monetary Policy

<monetarypolicy>

Monetary policy (largely through interest rate movements) may 
have affects on private consumption and investment decisions. 
However, once one removes the axiom of the maximisation of 
intertemporal utility as the dominant motivation for consumers, 
the scope for interest rates to affect private consumption 
decisions is considerably diminished. This is consistent with the 
empirical literature [cite sources] on the relatively low 
elasticity of consumption to interest rates.

Whether interest rates will affect private consumption 
significantly will depend very much on the institutional 
framework for consumption. In an economy in which a large part of 
the population buys houses on mortgages (particularly variable 
rate mortgages), there is no doubt that interest rates will 
affect income and consumption, both through the purchase of new 
housing (which also drives a significant part of the consumer 
durable market) and through the income and wealth effects on 
existing borrowers, where a rise in the interest rate will act as 
a tax on the borrower’s income and (over time) reduce the 
perceived value of assets (such as property). However, those 
parts of the population who are credit constrained (particularly 
the ‘poor’, as described above) or holders of financial assets 
(largely the ‘rich’ from above) will, in the former case, be 
insensitive to interest rate changes, and in the latter, have a 
positive income effect for a rise in the interest rate. Thus the 
social and institutional structure will determine if there is any 
sensitivity of consumption to interest rate movements.

The relationship of physical investment to interest rates is also 
unlikely to be a smooth monotonic function. In the paradigm of 
the macroeconomic textbooks entrepreneurs have the choice of 
investing in numerous projects with a well defined rate of return 
(possibly with a well defined variance around the expected rate 
of return). If the expected rate of return exceeds the interest 
rate (and the entrepreneur can secure the necessary capital - 
from borrowing, equity or own resources) the investment is likely 
to take place.

Hence, in this approach a fall in the (real) rate of interest 
will tend to raise the volume of investment, while a rise will 
diminish the volume of investment. There is little doubt that 
very high real rates of interest are effective in curtailing 
investment, and indeed severe monetary contractions can very 
quickly reduce investment levels, by raising enormously the risk 
of investment, in a moment when demand for final output is likely 
to fall. While the comparison of the relative returns on 
financial assets and physical investment may have some effect, 
there is little doubt that the principal effect of raising 
interest rates is to reduce the expected return of investment, 
through expected falls in aggregate demand. As discussed in 
section xxxx the likelihood of a very high variance of the rate 
of return on investment (particularly in countries with weak 
institutional structures), is also likely to reduce the 
elasticity of investment to the rate of interest.

Low rates of interest, however, may not have symmetric effects. 
While they may reduce slightly the costs of investment, they will 
not increase expected returns by as much as high rates depress 
expected returns. The experience of ultra-low interest rates 
since 2008 is perhaps the clearest illustration of this point. 
There has not been an extraordinary investment boom by historical 
standards. Nor have zero real or nominal rates suddenly made 
previously unviable investments viable, precisely because of the 
uncertainty over returns. What low interest rates have done is to 
raise asset prices, (property, shares, cryptocurrency, etc.), 
often purchased using cheap credit to leverage returns,[footnote:
This is the essence of Minsky’s financial Instability Hypothesis, 
 which argues that financial crises are not aberrations or due to 
policy errors, but rather inherent characteristics of capitalist 
economies with financial markets.
] as wealth holders look for alternative (and often more risky) 
assets to produce a return, as discussed in section xxxx. Over 
time the rise in asset prices may also contribute to raising 
consumption through wealth effects, at the expense of increasing 
the risks of reversing monetary policy, as evidenced by the 
economic crises of 2008 and 2022.

All these considerations suggest that private expenditure on 
consumption and investment may be affected by monetary policy in 
an uncertain and unpredictable manner. The effects of monetary 
policy will depend upon changing views about the future, of both 
consumers and investors. They are unlikely to be linear or even 
monotonic. In these circumstances, while it may be possible to 
identify at a specific moment in time an interest rate which will 
be consistent with full employment of resources at a low 
inflation rate, there will be nothing natural or stable about 
this interest rate, and indeed, in many circumstances it may not 
exist. There is no reason that a natural interest rate should 
exist once we dispense with the idea that interest rates in some 
sense reflect a trade-off between present and future consumption 
for consumers engaged in an exercise of intertemporal utility 
maximisation, or that it is related to the real (unknowable) 
return to physical capital.
