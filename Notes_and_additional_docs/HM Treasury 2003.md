“Where debt is low and there is a high degree of long-term fiscal sustainability, the case for adopting a tighter fiscal stance to allow room for governments to use fiscal policy more actively is not convincing. Provided that arrangements are put in place to ensure discretionary policy is conducted symmetrically then long-term sustainability would not in any way be put at risk.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 7])

“Evidence from a range of empirically estimated macroeconometric models tends to support the proposition that fiscal policy has significant short-run effects.1 The evidence generally suggests that consumers and firms are not especially forward-looking or their behaviour is constrained, reinforcing the potential effectiveness of fiscal action. This finding is also supported by survey-based evidence.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 8])

“The experience of the UK in the 1950s and 1960s when stabilisation policy was primarily done through fiscal policy, and the experiences of other countries, illustrates the difficulties in operating an effective counter-cyclical discretionary fiscal policy in practice: • discretionary fiscal policy often proved pro-cyclical. In particular, there was a tendency to react asymmetrically to an economic shock, given the bigger incentive to ease during a downturn than tighten during an upturn. In a number of countries this led to a sizeable build up in government debt; and • the lags in implementing fiscal policy and between its implementation and its effect on demand complicated the design of the stabilisation policy, and if prolonged enough, resulted in fiscal policy proving pro-cyclical.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 9])

“A key lesson from the current macroeconomic framework is the importance of the institutional design in ensuring a successful stabilisation policy. Reforms to the fiscal framework to overcome the problems of discretionary fiscal policy in the past should be based on the principles underpinning the current framework. These are: clear and sound long-term policy objectives; pre-commitment through institutional arrangements; and maximum openness, transparency and clear accountability.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 9])

“The lessons learnt from the history of discretionary fiscal policy in the UK and elsewhere, along with the principles underlying a successful macroeconomic framework, suggest a number of criteria to ensure that fiscal stabilisation policy is effective. These include: • policies should be designed to be symmetric over the business cycle; • policy should be forward-looking; • operating rules should be clear and transparent; and • the stabilisation policy objective should be clearly distinguished from other fiscal policy objectives. 13 There are also a number of criteria which will be useful to assess specific fiscal instruments: • an aim of maximising the effect on activity; • an aim of minimising lags; and • as with all tax and spending interventions, consideration must be given to the implications for wider government objectives, such as efficiency and equity.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 9])

“The advantage of increasing fiscal stabilisation by strengthening the automatic stabilisers is that many of the difficulties in operating fiscal policy for stabilisation purposes do not apply to the automatic stabilisers: there are no decision and implementation lags, left to themselves they generally operate symmetrically over the cycle, and they can be reasonably clearly identified and hence separated from other aspects of fiscal policy. However, other considerations apply, in particular, many of the ways to strengthen the automatic stabilisers can have a negative impact on economic efficiency.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 10])

“The institutional arrangements for fiscal policy could be developed to ensure the clear identification of stabilisation policy from other policy objectives, and to ensure that discretionary fiscal policy operates symmetrically, minimises lags and enhances transparency.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=10&annotation=SIKNYKWI))

“The adoption of an explicit stabilisation objective and a new fiscal rule would help ensure pre-commitment and that policy was operated in a symmetric way. While the existing fiscal rules, the golden rule and the sustainable investment rule, allow for the full use of the automatic stabilisers and where appropriate for discretionary fiscal policy, the new fiscal rule would impose a symmetric constraint on the operation of discretionary fiscal policy.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=10&annotation=839CCHQJ))

“Given the complexities of operating a more active fiscal stabilisation policy, there is a case for enhancing independent surveillance. This could be achieved by increasing the role of independent analysis (e.g. for technical elements such as ‘dating’ the economic cycle) or strengthening the monitoring of fiscal policy, through existing structures such as the EU. The publication by the Government of a regular Stabilisation Report would further enhance transparency and openness. Some authors have argued, drawing explicit parallels with monetary policy, for the delegation of fiscal stabilisation policy to an independent committee (an independent Fiscal Policy Committee). However, the establishment of such a body would be inconsistent with parliamentary tradition in the UK, and would challenge parliamentary sovereignty.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=11&annotation=CDJXVJDU))

“The paper considers the robust institutional framework required to ensure an enhanced fiscal stabilisation policy operates symmetrically, credibly and transparently, and which policy levers are likely to prove most effective. Credible policy options include a new symmetrical fiscal rule to trigger the Government to consider taking action, publishing a Stabilisation Report to enhance transparency, increasing the role of independent audit, a greater role for the tax regulators and specific fiscal instruments that could be used for stabilisation purposes.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=12&annotation=9EBYRDMS))

“However, where greater use of discretionary fiscal policy is envisaged, it is vital that the variations in the budget deficit are symmetric so that there is no deterioration in the average balance over the cycle. Section 6 considers the institutional arrangements that might go alongside a more active use of discretionary fiscal policy which would help underpin the need for symmetry. A key issue, as in other areas of the UK macroeconomic framework, is to promote a high degree of transparency, including through: well-defined objectives and operating rules, regular reporting and accountability arrangements, and ideas related to the open letter system for monetary policy.11” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=24&annotation=664RJID8))

“Another key insight from the theoretical literature is that forward-looking consumers will tend to be little affected by temporary changes in income taxes unless they are subject to liquidity constraints (or myopia) in which case their consumption will tend to be influenced by current income.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=27&annotation=9CVK69HQ))

“Liquid financial savings such as bank and building society accounts, equities, and premium bonds are key in allowing short-term smoothing of consumption. UK data on savings and wealth suggests, however, that a sizeable proportion of households have little financial means to smooth their consumption, at least for an extended period of time.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=28&annotation=MTPWCK76))

“The Family Resources Survey indicated that in the financial year 2000-01, 51 per cent of households had less than £1,500 in gross savings, while 28 per cent of households had no savings. A breakdown of savings by income groups confirms that households in the lowest income groups are more likely to have modest or no savings. Data from the British Household Panel Study (BHPS), analysed by Banks, Smith and Wakefield (2002) confirms this and indicates that when looking at net financial savings (savings minus debts), half of the population in 2000 held £600 or less.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=28&annotation=GWMKB43T))

“More recently Mankiw (2000) has concluded: “Although this [empirical] literature does not speak with a single voice, the consensus view is that consumption smoothing is far from perfect. In particular, consumer spending tracks current income far more than it should.”6 Further, there is plenty of evidence that many households have very little wealth and so: “Many households do not have the financial wherewithal to do the intertemporal consumption smoothing assumed by much modern macroeconomic theory... Acknowledging the prevalence of these low-wealth households helps explain why consumption tracks current income as strongly as it does.” 7” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=30&annotation=ZQZ22UPG))

“In summary, empirical studies have generally rejected full Ricardian equivalence. However, as long as there is a degree of consumption smoothing by households, the impact of any discretionary fiscal policy will generally be reduced. One caveat on the evidence concerns countries with very high debt to GDP ratios and where their fiscal framework lacks credibility, where something close to Ricardian equivalence is observed (as discussed in Box 3.5).” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=31&annotation=GYBQYLSG))

“As a consequence, changes in income taxes affecting higher-rate taxpayers are likely to have less short-term impact on demand than equivalent sized changes in income taxes affecting basic-rate taxpayers. Changes in benefits, for example those paid to the unemployed, are likely to have even more powerful effects on demand because people on benefits tend to have a very close link between their current income and their consumption.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=32&annotation=FBAX6ISB))

“A credible stabilisation framework should be based on four key principles: constrained discretion; sound long-term policies; maximum transparency; and pre-commitment. Current and historical experience point to a number of criteria that should be considered to ensure stabilisation policies are as effective as possible. These criteria can be split into two parts covering: the institutional framework; and instrument effectiveness. The stabilisation policy framework should be: 1) symmetrical; 2) forward-looking; 3) based on clear and transparent operating rules; and 4) separate from other government objectives. Effective instruments should: 5) maximise the impact on activity; 6) minimise lags; and 7) avoid negative impacts on economic efficiency and equity.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=39&annotation=HY5GJ6NM))

“Despite the problems associated with ‘stop-go’ cycles throughout the period, the principle of demand management remained widely accepted. The use of discretionary fiscal policy to ‘fine tune’ the economy reflected both a belief in Keynesianism as the predominant economic school of thought and a fundamental lack of understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism, a position made clear in the Radcliffe Report (1959). The Report’s principal recommendation for the use of monetary policy for demand management purposes was that “...we envisage the use of monetary measures as not in ordinary times playing other than a subordinate part in guiding the development of the economy.” 4,5” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=40&annotation=57X6ZN8T))

“The Radcliffe Report (1959), despite promoting the use of fiscal policy as the main stabilisation instrument, identified several drawbacks of the tools then in use. In particular, the Report noted the timeliness problems associated with the Budgetary cycle: “Their timing...is handicapped by dependence on the parliamentary timetable; and there are real administrative difficulties in making frequent changes in many tax rates.” 6” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=41&annotation=IYTRQQT3))

“n 1961, in recognition of the timeliness issue, the Government introduced the tax regulator (see Section 6) to facilitate a more rapid response to discretionary fiscal policy. The tax regulator provided the Chancellor with the ability to vary purchase tax rates on consumer goods by ten per cent in both directions in between Budgets.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=41&annotation=BJYYINAS))

“The shift towards using monetary policy as the predominant demand management tool continued in the 1980s. Over this period, a new approach to macro and micro economic policymaking was established. One of the clearest statements of the government’s new policy approach was set out by Nigel Lawson in the 1984 Mais Lecture. The Government’s macroeconomic objective was to keep inflation low by controlling the growth of the money supply and its microeconomic objectives were to create conditions that were conducive to increasing employment and growth.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=43&annotation=Y9FF2IBS))

“While the new approach represented an important development for stabilisation, the implementation of money supply targeting proved difficult. Policy makers neglected the impact of institutional changes (specifically, financial deregulation measures in 1979 and 1986) on the relationship between the money supply and prices.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=43&annotation=5P7HK3R4))

“The four key principles,16 for achieving macroeconomic stability are: • stability through constrained discretion – long-term stability requires an overall framework, which constrains macroeconomic policy to achieve clear long-term and sustainable goals, but which gives discretion to respond flexibly to shocks. If policy makers have a sufficiently credible commitment to long-term stability, then they will be able to exercise discretion in response to shocks without damaging long-term expectations; • credibility through sound long-term policies – governments can have policy credibility and maintain constrained policy discretion if they pursue monetary and fiscal policies, which are well-understood and sustainable over the long term; • credibility through maximum transparency – the greater the degree of transparency about the government’s objectives and the reasons why decisions are taken, the more information about outcomes that is published as a matter of routine, and the more checks on the ability of the government to manipulate the flow of information, the less likely it is that investors will be suspicious of the government’s intentions, the greater the flexibility of policy to react to real crises and the easier it is to build a consensus for difficult decisions; and • credibility through pre-commitment – the more institutional arrangements can demonstrate that policy is truly trying to achieve its declared objectives, and the more difficult it is for the government to cheat by breaking promises or aiming for different objectives, the more the public and investors will believe that decisions are being taken for sound long-term reasons.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=45&annotation=RYS448A4))

“If discretionary fiscal policy is to play a greater role in stabilisation policy then the framework needs to be developed in order to achieve this additional objective. More specifically, based on meeting the above principles and avoiding the mistakes from the past, the institutional framework for an effective stabilisation policy should be: 1) symmetrical; 2) forward-looking; 3) based on clear and transparent operating rules; and 4) separate from other government objectives.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=45&annotation=CXWE8F8N))

“For discretionary fiscal policy to be effective it should operate symmetrically over the cycle, easing in response to negative demand shocks and tightening in response to positive demand shocks. An asymmetric application of discretionary fiscal policy would damage credibility and undermine the sustainability of the public finances, reducing its future effectiveness and scope.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=46&annotation=Q8CQAHR2))

“An effective stabilisation tool should maximise the impact on activity appropriate to the stabilisation requirement. As Annex A illustrates, the impact on activity depends on the choice of stabilisation instrument. A number of factors will determine the size of the impact of a particular instrument. In terms of fiscal instruments these are: • the magnitude of the base of the stabilisation instrument relative to GDP; and • the size of the fiscal multiplier for the stabilisation instrument.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=47&annotation=ARXHFFWQ))

“adjusting existing taxes or benefits to meet a stabilisation objective will necessarily impact on some of the efficiency and equity goals, as set by the government. For example, the government sets unemployment benefits at a level that balances the conflicting objectives of fairness against creating the right incentives to make work pay. Clearly, varying levels of unemployment benefit over the cycle as a means of stabilising the economy might run against these other policies. It is important, therefore, that stabilisation policy measures are consistent with wider policy objectives. The separation of stabilisation policy from other government objectives will go some of the way to avoiding a negative impact on efficiency and equity.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=49&annotation=BJ8P3ASM))

“The empirical evidence for the size of the fiscal multipliers tends to suggest that shortterm expenditure multipliers are larger than those for tax (see paragraph A10 in Annex A). This means that while the revenue side of the public finances is more sensitive to the cycle, it could be the spending side which has a more significant effect on GDP in the short term. For example, the fiscal multiplier associated with changes in social security payments is likely to be high. Those who receive social security payments are likely to be liquidity constrained and consume out of current income. Therefore, when social spending changes, this is likely to have a greater impact on consumption and GDP than equivalent changes to income taxes where the impact is at least partially smoothed away by households.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=56&annotation=J7L62YVZ))

“In theory, discretionary fiscal stabilisation policy has the advantage that it is highly flexible and can be tailored to meet given macroeconomic target(s) and to respond to specific shocks. However, as discussed in Section 4, the experience of the UK in the 1950s and 1960s, and that of other countries, illustrates the difficulties in operating an effective discretionary fiscal stabilisation policy in practice. In particular, the evidence suggests that policy in the UK was generally pro-cyclical and hence not a stabilising force.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=66&annotation=URAIAX4E))

“Instead the Government would introduce a trigger point which would initiate a procedure committing the Government to take action in order to meet the stabilisation objective. A credible option would be a rule under which the Government would commit to undertake a discretionary fiscal policy response if the forecast of the output gap3 exceeded, say, 1 or 1.5 per cent of GDP, unless the Government believed that there was a strong case against such a discretionary fiscal policy action. In either case, the Government could be required to publish an open letter to Parliament, explaining: • why the output gap was forecast to exceed the pre-announced trigger value; • how the action it is taking is consistent with achieving greater stabilisation, or its reasons for not taking discretionary fiscal policy action; • the period in which it expects the output gap to reduce to within the preannounced range; and • how this approach meets the other fiscal policy objectives and the Government’s wider economic objectives.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=70&annotation=GW9C3WNH))

“One credible option would be for the Government to publish a regular Stabilisation Report on a preannounced timetable. The Report could be, for example, published on a quarterly basis, with one released at the time of the Budget, and three additional reports a year. This would also help ensure that the discretionary fiscal policy was timely by making sure that the Government undertook decisions on stabilisation policy on a quarterly basis (even if no changes in policy instruments were needed). 6.23 The Stabilisation Report could mirror the current framework for the Inflation Report, setting out: • an analysis of recent macroeconomic developments, including the latest forecasts for UK output, inflation and the public finances; • an assessment as to whether the UK output gap was likely to exceed the preannounced trigger value over the forecast horizon; and • if so, a description of the Government’s planned response. This could explicitly identify the fiscal instruments to be used for stabilisation purposes and indicate the process for their reversal in future, helping to ensure that the discretionary fiscal policy changes were understood to be temporary and that ‘ratchet effects’ were avoided.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=73&annotation=W3GUUD5S))

“Another option that has been considered in other countries to increase openness and transparency, and increase the emphasis on the symmetry of fiscal policy, is the creation of a specific Stabilisation Fund. This would be recorded in the public accounts but clearly distinct from other parts of the public finances. Examples of funds in operation in other countries are outlined in Box 6.6. These tend to differ according to the precise institutional arrangements in place. 6.34 Any such Fund could collect revenue when fiscal policy was tightened for stabilisation purposes and could be the source of finance when fiscal policy was loosened for stabilisation purposes. In principle, inflows and outflows should sum to zero over the cycle, providing a check that stabilisation policy was operated symmetrically. In practice, the Fund need not necessarily be an explicit constraint on decision-making, but rather a mechanism to create greater transparency.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 78](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=78&annotation=459DJ2E7))

“Some authors have taken this a step further, drawing explicit parallels with monetary policy, and arguing for the delegation of fiscal stabilisation policy to an independent committee – a fiscal policy equivalent of the MPC or a Fiscal Policy Committee (FPC). Box 6.7 provides detail on some of the different proposals” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 79](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=79&annotation=8NDG9YXR))

“An additional criteria for the effective use of discretionary fiscal policy for stabilisation purposes is that it must operate in a timely manner. As discussed in Section 4, the outside lags – those between enacting a policy change and its impact on demand – are likely to be of a similar order for fiscal policy as monetary policy (and may be less in the case of spending changes) and are minimised through the adoption of a forward-looking framework. However, the inside lags of fiscal policy have proved to be long in practice involving a lengthy decision making process and a long lead-time between the decision and the actual implementation of the policy change. Constraining fiscal policy changes to an annual Budget is clearly one reason for this. Hence, to make discretionary fiscal policy more effective for stabilisation purposes, there is a need to develop mechanisms to reduce inside lags in particular.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=80&annotation=CC4D3A73))

“Wren-Lewis (2000) suggests that a ‘fiscal regulator’ body be given the power to make temporary changes in a select number of instruments, and only in the interests of demand management.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 80](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=80&annotation=39EMDBTY))

“Legislative arrangements allowing the Government to alter certain tax rates outside the Budget process do already exist in the UK. The so-called ‘tax regulators’ allow rates of VAT and duty to be varied outside the Budget process using secondary legislation (See Box 6.8).” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 81](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=81&annotation=9QRKGE3U))

“Though rarely used in the past, these regulator powers could be used more actively for stabilisation purposes. They could be used as they stand (the suitability of different fiscal instruments including VAT and duty as stabilisation tools is discussed in Part B of this section), or they could be extended to other taxes specifically for stabilisation purposes. If the existing regulator powers were to be used for stabilisation, there is also a case for modernising them to make them more suitable for that purpose.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 81](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=81&annotation=Q64MGZIU))

“As one of the criteria for effective fiscal stabilisation is the need for a clear separation between temporary fiscal changes made for stabilisation purposes and fiscal changes made for other reasons, it may be desirable to define the regulator explicitly as a tool for stabilisation. This suggests that changes made for other reasons would not be made through the regulator – they would have to be made through the Finance Bill or other primary legislation. This could be set out in the regulator legislation itself, or it could be established in the fiscal framework. The temporary nature of all changes made through the regulators would reinforce this distinction.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=84&annotation=4LU8EX5Q))

“In summary, the analysis in this subsection suggests that if the UK were to join EMU: • the adoption of an explicit stabilisation objective and rule would add an element of pre-commitment and help ensure that discretionary policy operated in a symmetric way; • however, a rigid, formulaic fiscal rule would not be appropriate for this purpose. A procedure which committed the Government to take appropriate action under pre-defined circumstances and which triggered an additional layer of transparency would be more suitable; • the publication by the Government of a regular Stabilisation Report would further enhance transparency and openness; • given the complexities of operating a more active fiscal stabilisation policy, there is a case in EMU for increasing the role of independent audit of specific technical elements of fiscal stabilisation policy, and enhancing independent surveillance; • a stabilisation fund would be unnecessary if pro-cyclical outcomes can be avoided in other ways and if other mechanisms exist which create sufficient transparency; • the establishment of an independent fiscal policy committee would not be consistent with parliamentary tradition in the UK, as it would challenge parliamentary sovereignty with respect to fiscal policy; and • greater use of the existing tax regulator power would help to minimise lags in the use of discretionary fiscal stabilisation policy, and reforms could increase their suitability for this purpose.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=85&annotation=IKFDN4BQ))

“In theory, discretionary fiscal stabilisation policy could be carried out through either taxation or expenditure changes (or some combination of the two). At first glance, changes to public spending seem attractive given their potentially powerful short-term effect on demand and output. Indeed, the analysis earlier and the results from the macroeconomic models presented in Annex A suggest that the short-term impact of spending changes might exceed that of income tax changes.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=86&annotation=RWI8CKZE))

“In theory, equity concerns could be minimised by ensuring that any changes in income taxes for stabilisation purposes preserved the existing distributional effects. For example, Gruen (2001) suggests that all tax rates (both personal and corporate taxes) could be multiplied by a taxation parameter. This would initially be set at 1, but could be then changed up or down as required. For example, an increase of 10 per cent (taxation parameter = 1.1) would mean increasing tax rates by 10 per cent (eg from 22 per cent to 24.2 per cent). Such an across-the-board increase in income taxes would be strongly progressive. 6.68 Gruen also suggests two other options. The first, allowing the lowest marginal tax rate to vary. This would tend to maximise the effect of changes in the fiscal stance on demand, by targeting the most liquidity constrained consumers, but it also would be seen as unfair, because it would impose high volatility on low income earners. Alternatively, a flat-rate tax could be levied on all income over a certain low income threshold – in Australia the mechanism for this already exists through the Medicare Levy. This would be akin to shifting the tax allowance up or down. Equity issues would also arise.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=88&annotation=RB78BBN9))

“6.102 In summary, the analysis in this subsection suggests that: • using government spending for stabilisation purposes would not be sensible, as any changes made would involve long inside lags and frequent changes would conflict with the current medium-term spending framework; • using income taxes and national insurance contributions would create significant practical problems and may have only a relatively limited stabilisation impact; • while a consumer credit tax has advantages in principle, in practice there is no realistic prospect of implementing it effectively; • while temporary investment incentives could affect the timing of investment decisions, this impact might be quite small, and frequent use of temporary tax incentives would increase uncertainty, damaging long-run investment in the economy; • fiscal instruments impacting on the housing market could help reduce volatility in this sector of the economy, through ‘automatic stabiliser’ properties, as well as potentially providing an additional discretionary stabilisation tool; and • temporary changes to a combination of expenditure taxes, for example through the regulator power, could prove to be a powerful fiscal stabilisation tool, with limited impacts on incentives and the overall equity of the tax system.” ([HM Treasury, 2003, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/5C93LZ95)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLIGJ23H?page=95&annotation=QW9DK43X))
